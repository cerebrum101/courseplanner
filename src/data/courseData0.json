Comparative case studies will provide material for our in-class discussions where we will deliberate how humans have built complex organizational structures to assert their power, take it from others, and to shape various modes of identity through agency. Anthropological literature that explores and questions traditional notions of civilization and complexity will provide a theoretical framework for broaching these topics intellectually and with a critical mind.

Various types of surface forces and their origin will be discussed from the point of view of the Derjaguin-Landau-Vervey and Overbeek theory and more modern theoretical models. Techniques for measuring of surface forces will be presented. Wetting and spreading phenomena, concepts for contact angles and spreading coefficients will be discussed, along with hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. Methods for preparation of colloids based on dispersion and condensation techniques will be presented and discussed with examples of various colloids. Characterization of the surface charge and the size distribution of colloidal particles. Electrokinetic mobility and Zeta-potential will also be considered. Several classes of colloids of industrial importance will be studied in detail, like suspension, emulsions and foams. Concepts like Brownian motion, sedimentation velocity, dispersion destabilization mechanisms, Ostwald ripening, coalescence, creaming will also be covered. Bancroft rule for preferred type of emulsions and hydrophile-lipophile balance for choice of preferred type of surfactant will be discussed. Structural properties of foams will also be covered. Examples of practical applications of foams, emulsions and suspensions in a variety of industrial and consumer products will be discussed.   ",

Students taking this course will acquire an understanding of economists' approach to analyzing both how, and how well, financial markets organize inter-temporal allocation of scarce resources. Topics that can be covered in this course include: inter-temporal allocation by consumers and firms when future payments are certain/uncertain, portfolio theory, the capital asset pricing model, the efficient market hypothesis, insider trading, financial derivatives, and risk management.

Cognitive linguistics is based on the assumption that linguistic phenomena are rooted in general cognitive capacities and therefore, linguistic research should be informed by and accord with what is known about the mind and brain from other disciplines. The course acquaints the students with the main principles and notions of cognitive linguistics. The students practice applying cognitive methods to the analysis of linguistic phenomena in English, Russian, and Kazakh languages.

Discourse and Grammar is an interdisciplinary framework that looks at the development of grammatical constructions from the point of view of language use. Discourse and Grammar is based on the assumption that speakers make functional choices at every level of structure and that, as such, grammatical constructions arise from the functions they serve for language users. The course will cover the two major direction of the interface between grammar and interaction: (1) how grammatical structures arise from fluid patterns of language use; (2) how stable structures of grammar provide templates for linguistic action.  The course acquaints the students with the main principles and notions of Discourse and Grammar, as well as with the different qualitative and quantitative methods used to carry out research in the discipline. The students practice applying these methods to the analysis of linguistic phenomena in Kazakh languages.  The forms of instruction include lectures, article presentations and discussions, and practical linguistic analysis.",

In the first part of the course (until week 6), we introduce fundamental concepts of quantitative analysis (variables and hypothesis), discuss the logic of quantitative studies, and cover the basics of a programming language (R or Python). We discuss a variety of descriptive graphs, measurements (frequency and dispersion), and tests (tests for independence, distribution) for monofactorial analysis. We end the module by implementing these concepts trough popular corpus-linguistics techniques (frequency lists, key words, collocations). We then move on to the second section of the course (until week 11) , where we explore techniques for multifactorial analysis that are frequently in linguistics (linear and generalized linear regression modeling, classification trees, and random forests). In the last weeks of the course we discuss and implement best practices for dataset preparation and data visualization. We study these topics on linguistic datasets.",

The course deals with the formulation of the laws of mechanics describing the motion of massive bodies under the presence of external forces. This formulation is related to the mathematical structure of space and time and requires several advanced mathematical tools. The relevant mathematical background is to be introduced during the course when required. The course covers Newton’s Laws, Reference frames, Gravitation, Oscillations, Central Motion, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Dynamics. The topics learned in Classical Mechanics constitute the natural starting point for all other branches of theoretical physics including Astrophysics, Quantum Mechanics, Fluid Dynamics, Thermodynamics, Dynamical systems and Relativity.",

The properties and phenomena in solids are studied as a result of their interaction with external radiation, fields and particles. Take all the fundamentals of physics, including classical and quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics and statistical physics, and put them all together to study a piece of matter. Critical applications in material science, nanotechnology, solid-state devices, thermal and electrical energy transport & conversion, and materials characterization techniques will also be addressed. A grasp of fundamental and advanced principles and techniques in solid-state physics is very important in much of modern applied physical sciences, high-technology as well as fundamental research.",

This is why it stands at the center of political sociology. Citizenship has four dimensions: membership status, human rights, political participation, and civic identity. In this course we follow the recent developments in Eurasian citizenship and identify key forces shaping it: state-building, nationalism, migration and population transfers, foreign policy, patriarchy, economic transition, etc. We discuss how today we can keep to the ancient ideal of being a “good citizen” and a “good human” at the same time?",

The course aims to broaden the 20th-century literary canon which has traditionally focused more on male than female authors. Rather than analyzing “female images” in literature, we will talk about texts created by female writers and the writing strategies that they employed. During the course, we will address a variety of texts studying them within the Soviet cultural and historical context, with close reading being the primary method of analysis. The main aspects of the course will be the examination of several cases that illustrate different literary strategies of female writers.",
